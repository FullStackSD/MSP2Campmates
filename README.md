### **Design**
The central theme of the website is camping, therefore,  I decide to select colours and elements that represented the outdoors. For this I carried out research into images of campsites and outdoor activities for inspiration for the colour pallete.

#### Fonts
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom") Google fonts: Roboto") font. This font is modern and easily readable.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I used icons from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons that were used were are all outdoor and nature themed or used to give emphasis to a certain section.

<a></a>
#### Colours
The colour scheme is based on outdoor and nature theme colours. I wanted the website ot appear  modern and clean. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to map out my colour scheme.

Colour Palette:
![Color Palette](assets/wireframes/color-pallete-campmates.png)

* #163A51: This dark blue colour is the primary colour for all headings and text. It is also the background of the main call to actions, check buttons and footer background.
* #005073: This is a deep blue colour used as an accent colour including the start button, the buy buttons and the clear/reset button.
* #2FA59E: This is a sea-green used minimally as a secondary colour for the icons in the About section.
* #F0F1F2: This is an off white/grey colour used for background blocks to break the website into sections. 
* #AAAAA: This is a light grey colour used for special icons. 

I used [Accessible Colors](https://accessible-colors.com/ "Accessible Colors") to make sure the colours in the design is at least AA compliant.

#### Logo
I found the logo on google images (https://logosear.ch/logos/freecodecamp/index.html)
